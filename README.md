# Tulips Webpage
#### Kalei Foley-Rutherfurd & Brynlee Crispin
The webpage that we created is a easily navigable webpage for learning more about tulips. It highlights 3 tulips that we thought were interesting, as well as a navigation for for different websites to learn more about tulips generally. 

Each webpage goes into a little bit more detail about each type of tulip. There is also a directory on the homepage to some interesting link to learn more about tulips.
